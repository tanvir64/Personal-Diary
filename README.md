# Personal-Diary
A C-based software application has been developed with the purpose of simulating the functionality of a **Personal Diary**.  
The application allows users to document their daily experiences and thoughts, much like traditional diary-keeping.  
Additionally, the application includes a unique feature that tracks the user's moods over the course of a week, represented through the use of a graphical representation, commonly referred to as a **"Mood graph"**.This feature aims to provide users with a visual representation of their emotional state and how it changes over time, allowing for deeper self-reflection and understanding.The implementation of this feature is achieved through the use of various data structures and algorithms, such as arrays and looping constructs, to store and process the user's input.  
Overall, this software application serves as an innovative tool for personal self-expression and introspection.
